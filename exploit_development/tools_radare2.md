# Radare2

radare2 is, amongst many other things; a disassembler, debugger and binary analysis tool. It's absurdly powerful and you have more or less everything you need to complete the challenges on this site entirely within the radare2 framework. It's actively developed and you can find more detail on their [github](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2) page which also hosts a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/blob/master/doc/intro.md).
